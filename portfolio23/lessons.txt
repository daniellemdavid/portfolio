    Definitions
        Components are javascript functions that return jsx (javascript extension). 
            JSX looks like html but it isn't
                jsx is translated to javascript by babel. calls the createElement method on the react component which is generated by the ReactDom.
        useState is a react hook that is used to rerender a component based on a state change. 
            const [obj, setObj] = useState(objInitialValue);
    Anatomy of a Component:  
        -"className" is a reserved keyword used in components as opposed to "class" (such as in html)   
        -function components ( functionName = () => ) are recommended as opposed to a class that extends the React.      Component class.   
        -Once we have a component we can use it in the composition of another component
    Rendering list:

    Errors
        x Project component not rendering
        x CSS - styles not working
            global css refuses to be called anything but globals.css -_-
    useState
        imported from react library
        Must always be in the highest level of the function (before the return)
        first item in the array is an object that represents the current state
        the second item is a function that changes the state

    useEffect
        takes a function as the first parameter and an array for the second parameter   
            the second parameter is a list of dependencies (?) and can be empty if there are none ( [] )
                ? array list of variables/func/obj/etc.. which when changed in anyway should cause useEffect to run again.
        used to implement unpredictable elements into the react program
            such as api, setTimeout, browser api etc...
