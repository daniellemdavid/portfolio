    Definitions
        Components are javascript functions that return jsx (javascript extension). 
            JSX looks like html but it isn't
                jsx is translated to javascript by babel. calls the createElement method on the react component which is generated by the ReactDom.
    Anatomy of a Component:
        -"className" is a reserved keyword used in components as opposed to "class" (such as in html)   
        -function components ( functionName = () => ) are recommended as opposed to a class that extends the React.      Component class.   
        -Once we have a component we can use it in the composition of another component
